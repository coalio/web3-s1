# S1 - Introduction to Blockchain

### Requirements

You need:

- An account with funds
- Access to the CELO Alfajores testnet

### Step 1. Use your private key

Open your wallet extension and find the private key under your account details, then copy it and
replace it within index.js

### Step 2. Use or install the node.js version required

In the .nvmrc file, you can see which version is required for you to run this project. If you're unsure about
how to install and use multiple node.js versions, you should investigate about [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

### Step 3. Run the index.js script

`node index.js` and you should be ready to go!
